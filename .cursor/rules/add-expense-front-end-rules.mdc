rules:
  - "Always use React functional components with hooks (useState, useEffect)."
  - "Prefer controlled components for form elements (dropdowns, inputs)."
  - "When editing table cells, use click-to-edit behavior and update state immutably."
  - "Use descriptive variable names (e.g., `selectedStatus`, `editingCellIndex`)."
  - "Use TailwindCSS for any new UI styling, with semantic class names."
  - "Keep components small and reusable. Extract dropdowns into separate components if needed."
  - "Do not use deprecated React features like class components or UNSAFE_ lifecycle methods."
  - "Write code with TypeScript types if the file already uses TypeScript."
  - "Keep code DRY and avoid duplicating logic. Use helper functions if needed."
  - "When making changes, update only relevant parts of the code and avoid breaking existing functionality."
